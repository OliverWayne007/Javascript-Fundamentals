DOM refers to the Document Object Model

We are able to access all our HTML elements through Javascript because of this Document Object Model.

Window object is not a Javascript object.

Window object is created by the browser itself automatically.

This Window object is accessible in the browser console but not in nodejs because it is not a feature of Javascript. It is a global
object provided by the browser.

Similarly, the document object which is present inside the document object is not accessible in nodejs because again it is not a
feature of javascript. It is also created by the browser itself.

This document object contains the entire HTML code of the web page in the form of objects.

Whenever a web-page is loaded in the brower, the browser creates a global window object, which is an object representation of the
open tab in the browser. Inside this window object, the browser creates a document object, which is models the entire HTML code of 
the web-page in the form of objects. This document object is accessible or available to javascript when executing the javascript code
in the browser console. It is because of this "Document Object Model" that we are able to access all our HTML elements and 
manipulate them using Javascript, thereby adding logic and interactivity to our web-page. 
This what is called "Making our web-page Dynamic". Now, since all this manipulation of the web-page that happens when a user 
interacts with the HTML elements like clicking buttons etc, is visible to the user on his browser, it is called "Front-End".


document.getElementsByClassName("class-name") returns an HTML-Collections.

document.getElementById("id") returns a unique html element.

document.querySelector() returns the first element.

document.querySelectorAll() returns a nodeList.
